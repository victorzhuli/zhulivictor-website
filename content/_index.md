I am a **Staff Research Engineer II** at Digital Health Lab, [Samsung Research America](https://www.sra.samsung.com), Mountain View, CA. I lead AI-driven innovation at the intersection of wearable sensing and real-world health monitoring, delivering solutions from prototyping to clinical validation.

My research has been featured on the **IEEE JBHI journal cover (2023)**, and I have authored **45+ publications** at top-tier venues with **15+ patents** filed. My work spans cuffless blood pressure monitoring, contactless vital sign detection, atrial fibrillation burden estimation, and advanced bio-sensing technologies.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Rutgers University in 2018, where I developed computational methods for predicting behavior from neuroimaging data. Prior to my Ph.D., I spent nearly a decade in the consumer electronics industry in China, including five years as an **R&D Manager** leading a 20+ member multidisciplinary team in hardware design and product development for professional audio/video systems.
